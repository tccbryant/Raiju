//INFO: This is the Audio script used within the Game Object audio_manager. This handles all our audio changes through scripts. It basically changes the parameters we see in the editor through code. The code in update is for allowing key input to change parameters such as volume, mute, global stop. 
//USAGE: use these sample methods in other classes:

/*public void stopAudio(){
      playingAudio = false;  //<- this just is for toggles
      GameObject am = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("audio_manager");
      Audio_Script am_script = am.GetComponent<Audio_Script>();
      am_script.stopAudio();
   }
   
   public void playAudio(string file, [int time || double percent]){
      playingAudio = true; //<- this is just for toggles
      GameObject am = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("audio_manager");
      Audio_Script am_script = am.GetComponent<Audio_Script>();
      am_script.playAudio(file, [time || percent]); You pass time xor percent; time is of type int; percent is of type double;  its an overloaded function. If you pass an integer it will start the audio that many seconds in. If you pass a double, it will play starting at that percent of the way through
   }
   
   playSFX(string file){
      used simlar to playAudio but intended for short sound effects as this method is made not to need a method to stop it
   }
